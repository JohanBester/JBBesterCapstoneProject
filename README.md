## Usage: 
This App should be pretty simple to use, Once installed the UI has an input fieled for a zip code, and two option buttons – one for school and one for event. 
Toward the bottom of the display, 2 simple text buttons offer the options to "Add School / Event" or to "Contact Us".

Clicking the "Add School / Event" button opens a form interface that requests info about the submitter and the addition to be made. 

Clicking the "Contact Us" button opensa a form interface that allows the users to write to the creator of the app.

Searching (submitting) without a zip will ask for one to continue.
The option buttons are optional. Searching without an option selected will return all schools and events that match the zip code search parameters.

When search results are returned, first results returned will fall into a default 50-mile radius. Filtering options and a search button will be presented to narrow the search. Filter drop-down options will include fields for… Zip, State, Radius, and Type (which would be school, event, or all). Choosing new options and clicking the search button agian will return the new seerch results.
