# STIX_Capstone

## Project name: 
STIX FMA Fun Finder


## Description: 
The STIX project has been built as my capstone project for the June 2020 Savvy Coders full-stack bootcamp. 
This application offers a very simple application to help enthusiasts find the closest **Filipino Martial arts clubs or events** in their area.

## Documentation:
Documentation for this project has been collected into the DOCS folder in the GitHub repository root. The DOCS can be accesed by clicking [this DOCS Link here](https://github.com/JohanBester/JBBesterCapstoneProject/tree/master/DOCS).

Most all of the planning layout for the project was done on [my Trello board](https://trello.com/b/zWx1qQFB/stix-fma-fun-finder) which can be accessed by clicking this link: [https://trello.com/b/zWx1qQFB/stix-fma-fun-finder](https://trello.com/b/zWx1qQFB/stix-fma-fun-finder).

## Installation: 
More installation instructions will be added as they become clearer, but the application will initially be available as a website, and eventually as a mobile app.
The web URL for the STIX FMA Fun Finder is as follows: [https://stix-fma-funfinder.netlify.app/](https://stix-fma-funfinder.netlify.app/)

## Usage: 
This App should be pretty simple to use.The home page has a button that leads to the main search page.
On the search page a zip code is required along with a radius that can be chosen from the drop=down menu.
Other options can be chosen as well to limit the results returned.

Searching (submitting) without a zip will ask for one to continue - a zip code is required. A radius is also required.

When search results are returned, first results returned will fall into the target radius. Filtering options are present to narrow the search. Filter drop-down options will include fields forâ€¦ Zip, State, Radius, Type (which would be school, event, or all), and style (which could be Arnis, Escrima, kali, or All). Choosing new options and clicking the search button agian will return the new seerch results.

Toward the bottom of most pages, a simple text button offers the options to "Add more information to the FMA application. 
Clicking the "Add a School / Event" button opens a form interface that requests info about the submitter and the addition to be made. 

In the application-wide footer there are 3 buttons - "About", "Home", "Contact".
Clicking on the "About" button takes the user to the about us page with basic info on the application.
Clicking the "Contact" button opensa a contact us form interface that allows the users to write to the application owner.

## Credits: 
I am grateful for the experience of the Savvy Coders full-stack web development bootcamp. I have learned an incredible amount in a very short time. 

I am particularly grateful for Dezerae Abelon who believed in me and got me into Savvy Coders, for my TA, Vanessa Kratohvil, for our fearless instructor, Martin Carriel, and his awesome teaching and coding help, for Brandon Bunch and the other Tas, and for all the other teachers and dedicated staff of Savvy Coders. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Thank you also for the lovely friends of our June 2020 bootcamp cohort! Folks, we made it. We are sad for those who left early, but we are glad that we could see this through together!
It is heartening to know that my collaboration with Savvy Coders will continue as longs as I wish. Thanks again!
