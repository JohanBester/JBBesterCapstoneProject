      <h2 class="secHead"> The Filipino Martial Arts</h2>
      <p>The Filipino Martial Arts, or FMA as we call it, is a lesser known sport but one of the fastest growing sports in the world. Not only is FMA a great sport, it’s easy for anybody to pick-up, and is one of the most effective self-defense systems in the world.</p>
      <p>Filipino martial arts (FMA) (Filipino: Sining panlaban ng Pilipinas) refer to ancient Malay and newer modified fighting methods devised in the Philippines. It incorporates elements from both Western and Eastern Martial Arts, the most popular forms of which are known as <b>Arnis</b>, <b>Eskrima</b>, and <b>Kali</b>.</p>
      <p>The origin of <b>Arnis</b> can be traced back to native fighting techniques during conflicts among the various Prehispanic Filipino tribes or kingdoms, though the current form has Spanish influence from old fencing which originated in Spain in the 15th century.</p>
      <p>The most commonly accepted explanation for the origin of <b>Escrima</b> systems is that they were originally the fighting systems possessed by every tribe in the Philippines and used by them to fight each other. When the Spanish conquistadors arrived, some tribes fought them, using native weapons and techniques.</p>
      <p>Kali is primarily a weapons-based style of fighting. Thus, it involves inflicting bad, often fatal damage to opponents with the use of weapons and empty hand techniques as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>Practitioners of the arts are called arnisador (male, plural arnisadores) and arnisadora (female, plural arnisadoras) for those who call theirs arnis, eskrimador (male, plural eskrimadores) or eskrimadora (female, plural eskrimadoras) for those who call their art eskrima, and kalista or mangangali for those who practice kali.</p>

      <h2 class="secHead">About the FMA Fun Finder</h2>
      <p>The Filipino Martial Arts have always been practiced in a community, and we still do it that way today!</p>
      <p>Despite the growing popularity of all the Filipino martial Arts, it can often still be hard to find a club, group, school, or events where one can meet other practitioners. <br/>We hope that through this application it would become easier for FMA practitioners to find each other, and list their club, school, or event for others to find. <br/>If you know of a club, school, or event that does not appear on our lists, please take a moment to click the link to add that information. It is by sharing that our community and our sport will grow.</p>
